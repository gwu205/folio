### Building off the existing brand, I renewed the logo and website to breathe a breath of fresh air into the brand image.

_As a member of Crowd Cast, I was tasked with renewing the website and image of the corporate brand. Here, Iâ€™ve documented my personal thoughts and design process - this does not in any way represent the company._

**The project**

### Crowd Cast develops financial solutions for small-to-medium enterprises and aims to bring their internal accounting infrastructure paperless and up-to-date with the modern age in Japan.

**Updating the visuals**

### Instead of undertaking a complete redesign, I used the original artwork as a base, rebuilding the logo on a geometric grid for better consistency and legibility in a wide variety of contexts
