### I was approached by the client to redesign the Giv product website and implement the design for a cleaner, refreshing look to better resonate with the growing user base.

_Giv_ is a matching application that aims to facilitate and promote a service-based commerce system that relies on gratitude and the goodwill of others rather than anything of monetary value. Using the _Giv_ platform, users can sign up and talk to other members to organise an exchange of services (or goods).

Currently growing a user base in Japan exclusively, a professional stylist could use the platform to exchange their trade - hairdressing - in return for a locally-grown bag of rice and other fresh produce from someone who's a farmer by trade, as one of the many example scenarios made possible by the service.

### I developed a complete redesign, using the above supplied video as inspiration, to create and implement <a href="https://giv.link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopen">a new multi-language website</a>.

**Design process**

### I developed the product image and basis for the website, using a script typeface to communicate the sense of the individual.

One of the key ideas behind the product is 感謝 (gratitude); after a successful exchange, members send to each other a _Thanks Card_, where they express their gratitude for the other party's giving.

**Development process**

### The completed project is a multi-page site with localisation, custom images, videos, fonts, and blog-style user profiles.
