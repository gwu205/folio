### I undertook a complete user experience audit to analyse and dissect the primary target audience and purposes for using the app. Using this knowledge, I planned, designed, and executed a complete redesign of the app to better satisfy user needs.

### After having defined core user journeys and main features, I narrowed down the product's value proposition to the following three outcomes to be satisfied:

- Provide a navigable database of all members, activities and ongoing projects in my company
- Perform analysis to improve efficiency of all members in my workplace
- Achieve greater transparency in my organisation
