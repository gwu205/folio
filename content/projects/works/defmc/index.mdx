### I redesigned and developed a new website for a Family Doctor in Australia to better communicate critical information.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the client found it imperative to ensure that visitors to the clinic were aware of testing procedures and had the most up-to-date information available.

### In addition to refreshing the design, I rebuilt the site from the ground up - implementing support for news posts/blog, both English and Chinese text and SEO optimisation. This led to a substantial increase in user traffic and organic search hits from the previous site.
